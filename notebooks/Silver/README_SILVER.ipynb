    "# Silver Layer – Standardized & Cleaned Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The Silver layer contains cleaned, standardized, and conformed datasets\n",
    "derived from Bronze. Data quality rules are applied, schemas are stabilized,\n",
    "and business keys are prepared for dimensional modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Principles\n",
    "- One-to-one or reduced-grain transformation from Bronze\n",
    "- No aggregations\n",
    "- Deterministic, repeatable transformations\n",
    "- Schema enforcement and type standardization\n",
    "- Data quality checks applied before promotion to Gold\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Silver_Flight_Market\n",
    "- Grain: One row per airline market ticket\n",
    "- Source: Bronze flight market data\n",
    "- Key Columns:\n",
    "  - itin_id\n",
    "  - mkt_id\n",
    "  - carrier codes\n",
    "  - origin and destination airport identifiers\n",
    "- Measures:\n",
    "  - passenger_cnt\n",
    "  - market_fare_usd\n",
    "  - miles and distance attributes\n",
    "- Partitions:\n",
    "  - source_year\n",
    "  - source_quarter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformations Applied\n",
    "- Column renaming and standardization\n",
    "- Data type casting\n",
    "- Duplicate removal\n",
    "- Null handling and basic validations\n",
    "- Derivation of year and quarter attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational Notes\n",
    "- Silver is the single source for all Gold facts and dimensions\n",
    "- No business aggregations exist in this layer\n",
    "- ANALYZE is intentionally skipped due to external location constraints\n",
    "- Data is read by path for downstream Gold processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ownership\n",
    "Maintained by the Saihan Sadique.\n"
