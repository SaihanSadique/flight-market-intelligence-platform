The main objective of this project was to ingest interstate/intrastate flight data from the U.S. DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics, transform it into a production-style lakehouse using Databricks, and develop an analytics-ready platform in Power BI to enable QoQ passenger analysis, route performance benchmarking &amp; fare efficiency evaluation.
